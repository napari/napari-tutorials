# (WIP) napari theme

Source for napari's custom theme. Scripts use vanilla JavaScript and styles
use [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/). The files are preprocessed by
[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and stored in `napari/static`.

The base theme inherits [Sphinx's basic theme](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/tree/master/sphinx/themes/basic).
Check out the the basic theme source to get a better understanding of how
pages are generated.

## Credits

The build infrastructure was heavily inspired by the awesome
[Furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) theme.
